### 1. Check for Updates

Before you start working, ensure your local repository is up to date with the latest changes from the `main` branch.

```bash
git checkout main
git pull origin main
```

### 2. Create a New Branch

Create a new branch to work on your changes. The branch name should describe the feature or issue you're addressing.

```bash
git checkout -b <your-branch-name>
```

### 3. Make Your Changes

Implement the necessary changes or additions. Ensure that your changes align with the project structure and goals.

### 4. Stage Your Changes

Add the files youâ€™ve modified or added to the staging area.

```bash
git add <file1> <file2> ...
```

To stage all changes, you can use:

```bash
git add .
```

### 5. Commit Your Changes

Commit your changes with a descriptive message.

```bash
git commit -m "Your descriptive commit message"
```

### 6. Push Your Branch to GitHub

After completing your changes, push your branch to the remote repository on GitHub.

```bash
git push origin <your-branch-name>
```

### 7. Create a Pull Request (PR)

On GitHub, open a Pull Request from your branch to the main branch. Provide a clear and concise description of the changes you've made. Additionally, request a review from one of the collaborators. Wait for feedback and address them (if applicable) before proceeding to the next step.

### 8. Merge the PR

Once your Pull Request has been approved and all feedback has been addressed, you can proceed to merge your branch into the main branch.
